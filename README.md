This project was done as part of the "BIOL 7210 - Computational Genomics" course at Georgia Institute of Technology in the Spring 2023 semester. 

This was a group project.

The project had 5 different tasks and each of us was assigned to two tasks each. 

I was assigned to the "Gene Prediction" and "Comparative Genomics" groups, which were the second and fourth tasks respectively. The work done and the results for both of these tasks can be found in the "GenePrediction" and "ComparativeGenomics" folders respectively.
